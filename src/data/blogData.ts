## Group Travel in Ghana: Everything You Need to Know

Planning a group trip in Ghana can be incredibly rewarding — you get to split costs, share experiences, and create memories that last a lifetime. But it can also be logistically challenging. Here's our complete guide based on organising 50+ group trips across Ghana.

## Step 1: Choose Your Destination

### Top Destinations for Group Trips in Ghana

**Cape Coast & Elmina** — History, beaches, and the famous canopy walkway at Kakum National Park. Perfect for a 2-3 day trip.

**Akosombo & Volta Region** — The largest man-made lake in the world by surface area. Great for boat cruises, island visits, and waterfall hikes.

**Ada Foah** — Where the river meets the sea. Perfect for beach camping, water sports, and relaxation.

**Aburi Mountains** — Cool weather, botanical gardens, and mountain lodges. Ideal for a quick overnight escape.

**Wli Waterfalls** — Ghana's highest waterfall in the Volta Region. The hike is challenging but absolutely worth it.

## Step 2: Set Your Budget

Group trips in Ghana typically cost between GH₵300 and GH₵2,000 per person depending on:
- **Duration** (day trip vs. overnight vs. multi-day)
- **Destination** (local vs. further afield)
- **Accommodation** (budget vs. mid-range vs. luxury)
- **Activities** (basic sightseeing vs. adventure activities)

**Pro tip:** Collect deposits early to secure bookings and gauge commitment.

## Step 3: Sort Transport

For groups of 10-25 people, a chartered bus is usually the most cost-effective option. For smaller groups, shared rides or hired vans work well.

**Key considerations:**
- Book transport at least 2 weeks in advance
- Confirm pick-up and drop-off points
- Factor in fuel stops and travel time
- Have a backup plan for vehicle issues

## Step 4: Book Accommodation

Book early, especially during holiday weekends and festivities. Popular options for groups include:
- **Hotels** — Best for comfort and amenities
- **Guest houses** — Budget-friendly and often more flexible for groups
- **Airbnb** — Great value for large groups who want their own space
- **Camping** — Perfect for adventure-focused trips to Ada Foah or the Volta Region

## Step 5: Plan Activities

Don't over-schedule! Leave room for spontaneity and relaxation. A good mix includes:
- 1-2 planned activities per day
- Free time for exploration
- Group meals
- An evening social activity

## Step 6: Coordinate Communication

Create a dedicated WhatsApp group for trip communication. Share:
- Itinerary and meeting points
- Packing list
- Payment deadlines
- Emergency contacts
